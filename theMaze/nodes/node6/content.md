### The Self-sacrificing (Reluctance + Pride)

Many activities in life, like doing household chores (Figure 11a) or tedious workouts can be unpleasant because
people feel averse to engaging in them. However, the experience will become rich if it provides, in addition to
the reluctance, the opportunity for people to realize that what they are doing is somehow good for them in the
long run. In fact, the more effort or sacrifice is needed to complete a task, the more self-satisfaction people get
during the task and afterwards. For example, a person that gets up early despite the enjoyable comfort of his bed
may feel proud for not giving in to the temptation of sleeping late (Figure 11b). The reluctance makes people
experience the world as a little harsher, bleaker, and more demanding environment. In addition, under the
influence of the protective frame, a person’s attitude transforms to become sterner, more determined and
disciplined. If design can facilitate this experience and attitude, it can be a useful motivator for people to engage
in activities that are not necessarily pleasant, or as a means to improve someone’s self-respect. Manufacturers of
very spicy hot sauces have clearly tapped into the self-sacrificing quality. Instead of focusing on good taste or
high-quality ingredients, these sauces are primarily marketed as giving a painful sensation, with product names
like ‘Sudden death’, ‘Beyond insanity’, and ‘100% pain’ (Figure 11c). The consumers of such products are
obviously not repelled by the prospect of some pain, and even use them to feel better about themselves or to
show off to others.
