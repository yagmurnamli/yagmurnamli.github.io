### The Sadistic (Maliciousness + Amusement)

The sadistic is the enjoyment that people draw from taking revenge, putting somebody back in their place, or
playing a prank. The governing condition in all these cases is that people have the opportunity to exploit an
advantage they have over another person or object. This might sound extreme, but in nuanced forms this
experience is relatively harmless and socially accepted. For example, office workers can exploit their
colleague’s trust and unsuspecting nature by playing a practical joke (Figure 5a). However, a harmful act can
also be socially useful, if it is directed at institutions or ideas that are though to have a lot of power. In that case,
the perpetrator is seen as the underdog and the harmful act as an expression of rebellion. For instance, making a
joke about religion, mocking a person of authority (Figure 5b) or disproving a powerful scientific theory can all
be enjoyable for this reason. This quality also manifests itself in the feeling of sweet revenge, when the act is
meant as punishment for someone else’s unacceptable behavior (see Knutson, 2004). De Quervain et al. (2004)
demonstrated that taking revenge activates a part of the brain that is associated with mental satisfaction and
reward. Pain Station is an art installation in the form of an arcade video game that utilizes the sadistic quality
(Figure 5c). Two users play a game of pong, while holding one hand on the so-called pain execution unit
(Morawe & Reiff, n.d.). Through different playing styles, the users have the opportunity to inflict different types
and intensities of pain in their opponent, thus raising the stakes and the enjoyment in the game.
