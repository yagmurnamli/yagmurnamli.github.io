### The Unreachable (Longing + Dreaminess)

Desired things that are out of reach elicit a kind of sadness in people that goes by names like nostalgia,
homesickness, and melancholy. The out of reach ‘things’ can be physical objects (e.g., an unaffordable dream
house–Figure 13a), people (e.g., a lover who is abroad), or experiences (e.g., one’s own past childhood–Figure
13b). The experience becomes rich if the affected individual can somehow interact with the absent object, or a
representation of it. Thus, people reminisce about the past by looking at photographs, exchange text messages
with their distant lover and those dreaming of owning a sports car may collect posters and even miniature
models of that car. Furthermore, the inherent sadness is not just negative - it also sets this experience apart from
more trivial desires. Consider the opposite situation: if a person could buy or achieve everything she desires at
any time, those things would arguably carry far less significance. Similarly, something that was once possessed
but now lost can be cherished more than when it was still present, as expressed by the saying “you don’t know
what you got ’til it’s gone”. The emotional experience affects a person’s attitude to become more connected to
the object and it promotes ‘daydreaming’ and contemplating about the object or concept. ‘Heirloom’ is a
product concept that stimulates people to get more attached to one of their possessions (Figure 13c). The user
puts the chosen object inside a glass jar, out of reach, where it is preserved for generations to come. Every
generation records their stories and memories related to the object, thus “transforming (…) a miscellaneous
item into a meaningful object (Ferguson, n.d.).”
