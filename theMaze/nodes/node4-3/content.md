### The Eerie (Anxiety + Fascination)

Whereas fright (the thrilling) is a reaction to a clear danger in the here and now, anxiety is directed to
ambiguous or intangible phenomena. Sometimes these anxieties have a functional basis, like being cautious of
catching a disease in a contaminated area (Figure 8a), but they can also be considered ‘irrational’, like being
afraid of the dark in a safe environment (Figure 8b). In both these experiences the whole surroundings can take
on a mysterious and suspenseful quality. Another instance of this quality can be found in what Freud (1919)
called ‘das Unheimliche’, or the uncanny: the feeling that one is observing something that is familiar, yet
strange. Roboticist Masahiro Mori (1970) famously applied this phenomenon to describe the ‘uncanny valley’,
which is the effect of objects resembling human beings almost, but not completely, which makes them very
eerie (Figure 8c). People who experience anxiety become hyper vigilant towards themselves and their
surroundings (Rhudy & Meagher, 2000), and become more suggestible to different explanations of their
feelings, up to the point where they can even use superstition to explain the event. This effect can be helpful in
design to make users more sensitive to events and information that they normally take for granted.
