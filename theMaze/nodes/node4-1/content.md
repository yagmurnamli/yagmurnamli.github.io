### The Thrilling (Fright + Joy)

Fright is at the basis of the kind of thrill that people feel when they undertake activities that carry a certain risk–
either real or imagined. For instance, many people feel a thrill when they suddenly have to speak for a large
audience (Figure 6a), which is instigated by fear of social failure. A clear example of an imagined risk occurs
when someone rides a rollercoaster (Figure 6b)–he knows the amusement park will make sure he is safe, but his
body tells him otherwise. Fright can even play a role when there is a ‘positive risk’ involved, such as when
people watch the lottery results in anticipation of winning. Fright is engaging because it focuses and energizes
people to either avoid or control the source of danger. This transformation of attitude can be useful and pleasant
when users have to engage in an uninspiring activity, or when they have to finish a task within a certain time.
Furthermore, fright makes people experience their immediate situation as eventful and overpowering, which can
be refreshing when they feel generally disinterested or bored. There are several thrilling children’s outdoor
games on the market that feature a water-filled object, which is passed around between players. When the
internal timer runs out, the person holding the device at that moment will get soaked (Figure 6c).
