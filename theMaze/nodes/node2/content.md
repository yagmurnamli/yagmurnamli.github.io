### Introduction

Consider the following new product concepts: a digital nutrition assistant that elicits disgust in people who are
grocery shopping, a thermometer that makes feverish children feel sad when it takes their temperature, and a
digital exercise coach that makes running laps a frightening experience. These concepts may seem strange at
first glance. Indeed, by eliciting negative emotions their purpose seems even contrary to that of experience
design: to provide people with pleasurable product experiences. However, we believe that these concepts
illuminate a promising new direction in experience design.
Several authors have published guidelines for experience-driven design. Although diverse, these existing
approaches share the objective to provide guidance in designing products that stimulate positive emotions and
experiences. For instance, Jordan (2000) suggested four sources of product pleasure, Norman (2004) discussed
three cognitive levels of pleasurable product experiences, Desmet (2008) proposed nine sources of product
appeal, and Arrasvuori, Boberg, and Korhonen (2010) surveyed and categorized 22 different ways for products
to elicit playfulness. In this paper we outline an approach that is different in purpose and even opposite in its
consideration of emotions. It is different in purpose because it aims to create rich experiences rather than
pleasure, playfulness or positive appeal, and opposite in its consideration of emotions because it conceives
negative emotions at the basis of these rich product experiences. Our aim is to show how product concepts
eliciting negative emotions, like the ones proposed above, can be created to systematically enrich user
experiences.
To show why and how negative emotions have a central role in rich experiences, it is necessary to define
what is meant by that last term. Firstly, the English word ‘experience’ can refer to a momentary experience of a
single event (in German: ‘Erlebung’), such as the experience of pain, but also to an episode of multiple
experiences that form a coherent whole (in German: ‘Erlebnis’), such as the experience of traveling by airplane.
Rich experiences are examples of such integrated ‘Erlebnissen’, whereas the specific emotions of which they
are composed are mostly individual ‘Erlebungen’. Secondly, to accurately define our notion of rich experiences,
we will identify the key characteristics that set them apart from non-rich experiences, thus gradually narrowing
the scope of definition. This definition-by-exclusion is visually represented in Figure 1, which also shows
examples of the different types of experiences. First of all, rich experiences are somehow a-typical and therefore
notable and memorable (2.), setting them apart from ordinary or mundane experiences that involve neutral,
mildly positive or mildly negative emotions (1.). Secondly, rich experiences are differentiated from other
notable experiences by being pleasant or by having some kind of beneficial effect on the experiencing
individual (2.2). This criterion excludes experiences that are notable, yet unpleasant and without any value to
the person experiencing (2.1). The remaining set of experiences can again be divided into two categories,
yielding a set of experiences that only involve strongly positive emotions (2.2.1), and a set of experiences that
involve a mix of negative and positive emotions (2.2.2). In brief, rich experiences are notable and memorable
experiences that involve a mix of positive and negative emotions and are experienced as valuable, because they
are pleasant, beneficial, or both.

### Ten Rich Experience Qualities

In this approach, any negative emotion, combined with a protective frame, can be the basis for a rich
experience, provided that it is elicited in an appropriate user context. This means that the number of possible
rich product experiences is in principle at least as extensive as the number of negative emotions. However, to
get a more tangible impression of the possibilities of the approach, we elaborated ten specific rich experience
qualities that we believe are worthwhile in user-product contexts. ‘Experience qualities’ (or just ‘qualities’) in
general are a concept used by designers to specify the type of experience the user should have with a product,
without yet establishing functional properties or even the type of product. It is akin to what Hassenzahl (2010,
pp. 17-19) calls an ‘experience pattern’: the essence of an experience that can be manifested differently in
different situations. The rich experience qualities specifically were developed by elaborating the three steps of
the approach for ten different negative emotions. Table 1 shows the overview of the ten rich qualities with a
short description and the three elaborated steps. Designers can use this overview as a guideline for
experimenting with the different emotions and rich experiences

### The following will share a few of these rich experiences, depending on how you choose to travel throught the story

The following sub-sections elaborate the nature and background of the ten qualities in more detail, by
showing examples of their occurrence in real life and references to literature from psychology and the
humanities. Most of the qualities also feature a product example. Since rich qualities are (still) very scarcely
used in mainstream products, most examples were derived from ‘critical design’ or from products designed for
entertainment. For purposes of structure and efficiency, we clustered the qualities into four categories, as some
have similarities between them that can be discussed jointly.
